## Key discussion points

- Why do we as an industry have a tendency to focus on home grown solutions?
- How important is governance of an open source project?
- When do we need (or don't need) contracts when collaborating?
- When to release a package?
- How do we build a community/get external contributions?
- What are the key concerns /learnings from the PHUSE community either using, releasing or co-creating R/Python packages or even SAS macros?
